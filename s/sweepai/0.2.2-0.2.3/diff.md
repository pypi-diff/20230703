+<b>Sweep</b> allows you to create and review GitHub issues with ease.
 Simply describe any issue and Sweep will do the rest.
 It will plan out what needs to be done, what changes to make, and write the changes to a PR.

 ## ‚ú® Demo
 For the best experience, [install Sweep](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to one of your repos and see the magic happen.
 
 [Demo](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/assets/44910023/365ec29f-7317-40a7-9b5e-0af02f2b0e47)
 
 ## üöÄ Getting Started
 
 ### üñ•Ô∏è Sweep Chat
 Sweep Chat allows you to interact with Sweep locally and will sync with GitHub. You can plan out your changes with Sweep, and then Sweep can create a pull request for you. 
 
 1. Install [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to desired repos
 
-2. Run `pip install sweepai && sweep`
+2. Run `pip install sweepai && sweep`. Note that you need python 3.11 or greater.
 
 3. This should spin up a GitHub auth flow in your browser. Copy-paste the üîµ blue 8-digit code from your terminal into the page. Then wait a few seconds and it should spin up Sweep Chat. You should only need to do the auth once.
 
 4. Pick a repo from the dropdown at the top (the Github app must be installed on this repo). Then start chatting with Sweep Chat. Relevant searched files will show up on the right. Sweep Chat can make PRs if you ask it to create a PR.

 ### ‚ú® Sweep Github App
 Setting up Sweep is as simple as adding the GitHub bot to a repo, then creating an issue for the bot to address.
 
 1. Add the [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to desired repos
 2. Create new issue in repo, like "Sweep: Write tests"
 3. "üëÄ" means it is taking a look, and it will generate the desired code
