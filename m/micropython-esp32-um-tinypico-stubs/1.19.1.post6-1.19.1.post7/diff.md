-The ``btree`` module implements a simple key-value database using external

-stored sorted in the database, and besides efficient retrieval by a key
-value, a database also supports efficient ordered range scans (retrieval
-of values with the keys in a given range). On the application interface
-side, BTree database work as close a possible to a way standard `dict`
-type works, one notable difference is that both keys and values must
-be `bytes` objects (so, if you want to store objects of other types, you
-need to serialize them to `bytes` first).
-
-The module is based on the well-known BerkelyDB library, version 1.xx.

+      board with enough memory using larger values may improve performance.
+      Cache policy is as follows: entire cache is not allocated at once;
+      instead, accessing a new page in database will allocate a memory buffer
+      for it, until value specified by *cachesize* is reached. Then, these
+      buffers will be managed using LRU (least recently used) policy. More
+      buffers may still be allocated if needed (e.g., if a database contains
+      big keys and/or values). Allocated cache buffers aren't reclaimed.
+    * *minkeypage* - Minimum number of keys to store per page. Default value
+      of 0 equivalent to 2.

-
-    The arguments are:
-
-      - ``id`` is mandatory and can be an arbitrary object.  Among possible value
-        types are: int (an internal Pin identifier), str (a Pin name), and tuple
-        (pair of [port, pin]).
-
-      - ``mode`` specifies the pin mode, which can be one of:
-
-        - ``Pin.IN`` - Pin is configured for input.  If viewed as an output the pin
-          is in high-impedance state.
-
-        - ``Pin.OUT`` - Pin is configured for (normal) output.
-
-        - ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN`` - Pin is configured for open-drain output. Open-drain
-          output works in the following way: if the output value is set to 0 the pin
-          is active at a low level; if the output value is 1 the pin is in a high-impedance
-          state.  Not all ports implement this mode, or some might only on certain pins.
-
-        - ``Pin.ALT`` - Pin is configured to perform an alternative function, which is
-          port specific.  For a pin configured in such a way any other Pin methods
-          (except :meth:`Pin.init`) are not applicable (calling them will lead to undefined,
-          or a hardware-specific, result).  Not all ports implement this mode.
-
-        - ``Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN`` - The Same as ``Pin.ALT``, but the pin is configured as
-          open-drain.  Not all ports implement this mode.
-
-        - ``Pin.ANALOG`` - Pin is configured for analog input, see the :class:`ADC` class.
-
-      - ``pull`` specifies if the pin has a (weak) pull resistor attached, and can be
-        one of:
-
-        - ``None`` - No pull up or down resistor.
-        - ``Pin.PULL_UP`` - Pull up resistor enabled.
-        - ``Pin.PULL_DOWN`` - Pull down resistor enabled.
-
-      - ``value`` is valid only for Pin.OUT and Pin.OPEN_DRAIN modes and specifies initial
-        output pin value if given, otherwise the state of the pin peripheral remains
-        unchanged.
-
-      - ``drive`` specifies the output power of the pin and can be one of: ``Pin.DRIVE_0``,
-        ``Pin.DRIVE_1``, etc., increasing in drive strength.  The actual current driving
-        capabilities are port dependent.  Not all ports implement this argument.
-
-      - ``alt`` specifies an alternate function for the pin and the values it can take are
-        port dependent.  This argument is valid only for ``Pin.ALT`` and ``Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN``
-        modes.  It may be used when a pin supports more than one alternate function.  If only
-        one pin alternate function is supported the this argument is not required.  Not all
-        ports implement this argument.
-
-    As specified above, the Pin class allows to set an alternate function for a particular
-    pin, but it does not specify any further operations on such a pin.  Pins configured in
-    alternate-function mode are usually not used as GPIO but are instead driven by other
-    hardware peripherals.  The only operation supported on such a pin is re-initialising,
-    by calling the constructor or :meth:`Pin.init` method.  If a pin that is configured in
-    alternate-function mode is re-initialised with ``Pin.IN``, ``Pin.OUT``, or
-    ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN``, the alternate function will be removed from the pin.

-
-             - ``wake`` selects the power mode in which this interrupt can wake up the
-               system.  It can be ``machine.IDLE``, ``machine.SLEEP`` or ``machine.DEEPSLEEP``.

+
+    The arguments are:
+
+      - ``id`` is mandatory and can be an arbitrary object.  Among possible value
+        types are: int (an internal Pin identifier), str (a Pin name), and tuple
+        (pair of [port, pin]).
+
+      - ``mode`` specifies the pin mode, which can be one of:
+
+        - ``Pin.IN`` - Pin is configured for input.  If viewed as an output the pin
+          is in high-impedance state.
+
+        - ``Pin.OUT`` - Pin is configured for (normal) output.
+
+        - ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN`` - Pin is configured for open-drain output. Open-drain
+          output works in the following way: if the output value is set to 0 the pin
+          is active at a low level; if the output value is 1 the pin is in a high-impedance
+          state.  Not all ports implement this mode, or some might only on certain pins.
+
+        - ``Pin.ALT`` - Pin is configured to perform an alternative function, which is
+          port specific.  For a pin configured in such a way any other Pin methods
+          (except :meth:`Pin.init`) are not applicable (calling them will lead to undefined,
+          or a hardware-specific, result).  Not all ports implement this mode.
+
+        - ``Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN`` - The Same as ``Pin.ALT``, but the pin is configured as
+          open-drain.  Not all ports implement this mode.
+
+        - ``Pin.ANALOG`` - Pin is configured for analog input, see the :class:`ADC` class.
+
+      - ``pull`` specifies if the pin has a (weak) pull resistor attached, and can be
+        one of:
+
+        - ``None`` - No pull up or down resistor.
+        - ``Pin.PULL_UP`` - Pull up resistor enabled.
+        - ``Pin.PULL_DOWN`` - Pull down resistor enabled.
+
+      - ``value`` is valid only for Pin.OUT and Pin.OPEN_DRAIN modes and specifies initial
+        output pin value if given, otherwise the state of the pin peripheral remains
+        unchanged.
+
+      - ``drive`` specifies the output power of the pin and can be one of: ``Pin.DRIVE_0``,
+        ``Pin.DRIVE_1``, etc., increasing in drive strength.  The actual current driving
+        capabilities are port dependent.  Not all ports implement this argument.
+
+      - ``alt`` specifies an alternate function for the pin and the values it can take are
+        port dependent.  This argument is valid only for ``Pin.ALT`` and ``Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN``
+        modes.  It may be used when a pin supports more than one alternate function.  If only
+        one pin alternate function is supported the this argument is not required.  Not all
+        ports implement this argument.
+
+    As specified above, the Pin class allows to set an alternate function for a particular
+    pin, but it does not specify any further operations on such a pin.  Pins configured in
+    alternate-function mode are usually not used as GPIO but are instead driven by other
+    hardware peripherals.  The only operation supported on such a pin is re-initialising,
+    by calling the constructor or :meth:`Pin.init` method.  If a pin that is configured in
+    alternate-function mode is re-initialised with ``Pin.IN``, ``Pin.OUT``, or
+    ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN``, the alternate function will be removed from the pin.

+               ``Pin`` instance.
+
+             - ``trigger`` configures the event which can generate an interrupt.
+               Possible values are:
+
+               - ``Pin.IRQ_FALLING`` interrupt on falling edge.
+               - ``Pin.IRQ_RISING`` interrupt on rising edge.

+
+               These values can be OR'ed together to trigger on multiple events.
+
+             - ``priority`` sets the priority level of the interrupt.  The values it
+               can take are port-specific, but higher values always represent higher
+               priorities.
+
+             - ``wake`` selects the power mode in which this interrupt can wake up the
+               system.  It can be ``machine.IDLE``, ``machine.SLEEP`` or ``machine.DEEPSLEEP``.
+               These values can also be OR'ed together to make a pin generate interrupts in
+               more than one power mode.
+
+             - ``hard`` if true a hardware interrupt is used. This reduces the delay
+               between the pin change and the handler being called. Hard interrupt
+               handlers may not allocate memory; see :ref:`isr_rules`.

+    Offset ticks value by a given number, which can be either positive or negative.
+    Given a *ticks* value, this function allows to calculate ticks value *delta*
+    ticks before or after it, following modular-arithmetic definition of tick values
+    (see `ticks_ms()` above). *ticks* parameter must be a direct result of call
+    to `ticks_ms()`, `ticks_us()`, or `ticks_cpu()` functions (or from previous
+    call to `ticks_add()`). However, *delta* can be an arbitrary integer number
+    or numeric expression. `ticks_add()` is useful for calculating deadlines for
+    events/tasks. (Note: you must use `ticks_diff()` function to work with
+    deadlines.)
+
+    Examples::
+
+         # Find out what ticks value there was 100ms ago
+         print(ticks_add(time.ticks_ms(), -100))

+    embedded boards without a battery-backed RTC, usually since power up or reset). If you
+    want to develop portable MicroPython application, you should not rely on this function
+    to provide higher than second precision.  If you need higher precision, absolute
+    timestamps, use `time_ns()`.  If relative times are acceptable then use the

-Low-level Bluetooth radio functionality. See: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.19.1/library/bluetooth.html
-
-This module provides an interface to a Bluetooth controller on a board.
-Currently this supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in Central, Peripheral,
-Broadcaster, and Observer roles, as well as GATT Server and Client and L2CAP
-connection-oriented-channels. A device may operate in multiple roles
-concurrently. Pairing (and bonding) is supported on some ports.
-
-This API is intended to match the low-level Bluetooth protocol and provide
-building-blocks for higher-level abstractions such as specific device types.
-
-``Note:`` This module is still under development and its classes, functions,
-          methods and constants are subject to change.

-            the IRQ handler has returned (e.g. by saving it in a class instance or global

-            used elsewhere in the program.  And to print data from within the IRQ handler,

+        into the same tuple, in the order that they are defined.
+
+        The following example registers two services (Heart Rate, and Nordic UART)::
+
+            HR_UUID = bluetooth.UUID(0x180D)
+            HR_CHAR = (bluetooth.UUID(0x2A37), bluetooth.FLAG_READ | bluetooth.FLAG_NOTIFY,)
+            HR_SERVICE = (HR_UUID, (HR_CHAR,),)
+            UART_UUID = bluetooth.UUID('6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E')
+            UART_TX = (bluetooth.UUID('6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E'), bluetooth.FLAG_READ | bluetooth.FLAG_NOTIFY,)
+            UART_RX = (bluetooth.UUID('6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E'), bluetooth.FLAG_WRITE,)
+            UART_SERVICE = (UART_UUID, (UART_TX, UART_RX,),)
+            SERVICES = (HR_SERVICE, UART_SERVICE,)
+            ( (hr,), (tx, rx,), ) = bt.gatts_register_services(SERVICES)
+
+        The three value handles (``hr``, ``tx``, ``rx``) can be used with
+        :meth:`gatts_read <BLE.gatts_read>`, :meth:`gatts_write <BLE.gatts_write>`, :meth:`gatts_notify <BLE.gatts_notify>`, and

+
+        **Note:** Advertising must be stopped before registering services.

+        ...
+    def irq(self, handler, /) -> int:
+        """
+            Registers a callback for events from the BLE stack. The *handler* takes two
+            arguments, ``event`` (which will be one of the codes below) and ``data``
+            (which is an event-specific tuple of values).
+
+            **Note:** As an optimisation to prevent unnecessary allocations, the ``addr``,
+            ``adv_data``, ``char_data``, ``notify_data``, and ``uuid`` entries in the
+            tuples are read-only memoryview instances pointing to :mod:`bluetooth`'s internal
+            ringbuffer, and are only valid during the invocation of the IRQ handler
+            function.  If your program needs to save one of these values to access after
+            the IRQ handler has returned (e.g. by saving it in a class instance or global
+            variable), then it needs to take a copy of the data, either by using ``bytes()``
+            or ``bluetooth.UUID()``, like this::
+
+                connected_addr = bytes(addr)  # equivalently: adv_data, char_data, or notify_data
+                matched_uuid = bluetooth.UUID(uuid)
+
+            For example, the IRQ handler for a scan result might inspect the ``adv_data``
+            to decide if it's the correct device, and only then copy the address data to be
+            used elsewhere in the program.  And to print data from within the IRQ handler,
+            ``print(bytes(addr))`` will be needed.

+        parameter name should be quoted as a string, and just one parameter is
+        queried at a time.  To set values use the keyword syntax, and one ore more
+        parameter can be set at a time.
+
+        Currently supported values are:
+
+        - ``'mac'``: The current address in use, depending on the current address mode.
+          This returns a tuple of ``(addr_type, addr)``.
+
+          See :meth:`gatts_write <BLE.gatts_write>` for details about address type.
+
+          This may only be queried while the interface is currently active.
+
+        - ``'addr_mode'``: Sets the address mode. Values can be:
+
+            * 0x00 - PUBLIC - Use the controller's public address.
+            * 0x01 - RANDOM - Use a generated static address.
+            * 0x02 - RPA - Use resolvable private addresses.
+            * 0x03 - NRPA - Use non-resolvable private addresses.
+
+          By default the interface mode will use a PUBLIC address if available, otherwise
+          it will use a RANDOM address.
+
+        - ``'gap_name'``: Get/set the GAP device name used by service 0x1800,
+          characteristic 0x2a00.  This can be set at any time and changed multiple
+          times.
+
+        - ``'rxbuf'``: Get/set the size in bytes of the internal buffer used to store
+          incoming events.  This buffer is global to the entire BLE driver and so
+          handles incoming data for all events, including all characteristics.
+          Increasing this allows better handling of bursty incoming data (for
+          example scan results) and the ability to receive larger characteristic values.
+
+        - ``'mtu'``: Get/set the MTU that will be used during a ATT MTU exchange. The
+          resulting MTU will be the minimum of this and the remote device's MTU.
+          ATT MTU exchange will not happen automatically (unless the remote device initiates
+          it), and must be manually initiated with
+          :meth:`gattc_exchange_mtu<BLE.gattc_exchange_mtu>`.
+          Use the ``_IRQ_MTU_EXCHANGED`` event to discover the MTU for a given connection.
+
+        - ``'bond'``: Sets whether bonding will be enabled during pairing. When
+          enabled, pairing requests will set the "bond" flag and the keys will be stored
+          by both devices.
+
+        - ``'mitm'``: Sets whether MITM-protection is required for pairing.
+
+        - ``'io'``: Sets the I/O capabilities of this device.
+
+          Available options are::
+
+            _IO_CAPABILITY_DISPLAY_ONLY = const(0)
+            _IO_CAPABILITY_DISPLAY_YESNO = const(1)
+            _IO_CAPABILITY_KEYBOARD_ONLY = const(2)
+            _IO_CAPABILITY_NO_INPUT_OUTPUT = const(3)
+            _IO_CAPABILITY_KEYBOARD_DISPLAY = const(4)
+
+        - ``'le_secure'``: Sets whether "LE Secure" pairing is required. Default is
+          false (i.e. allow "Legacy Pairing").

-
-    The arguments are:
-
-      - ``id`` is mandatory and can be an arbitrary object.  Among possible value
-        types are: int (an internal Pin identifier), str (a Pin name), and tuple
-        (pair of [port, pin]).
-
-      - ``mode`` specifies the pin mode, which can be one of:
-
-        - ``Pin.IN`` - Pin is configured for input.  If viewed as an output the pin
-          is in high-impedance state.
-
-        - ``Pin.OUT`` - Pin is configured for (normal) output.
-
-        - ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN`` - Pin is configured for open-drain output. Open-drain
-          output works in the following way: if the output value is set to 0 the pin
-          is active at a low level; if the output value is 1 the pin is in a high-impedance
-          state.  Not all ports implement this mode, or some might only on certain pins.
-
-        - ``Pin.ALT`` - Pin is configured to perform an alternative function, which is
-          port specific.  For a pin configured in such a way any other Pin methods
-          (except :meth:`Pin.init`) are not applicable (calling them will lead to undefined,
-          or a hardware-specific, result).  Not all ports implement this mode.
-
-        - ``Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN`` - The Same as ``Pin.ALT``, but the pin is configured as
-          open-drain.  Not all ports implement this mode.
-
-        - ``Pin.ANALOG`` - Pin is configured for analog input, see the :class:`ADC` class.
-
-      - ``pull`` specifies if the pin has a (weak) pull resistor attached, and can be
-        one of:
-
-        - ``None`` - No pull up or down resistor.
-        - ``Pin.PULL_UP`` - Pull up resistor enabled.
-        - ``Pin.PULL_DOWN`` - Pull down resistor enabled.
-
-      - ``value`` is valid only for Pin.OUT and Pin.OPEN_DRAIN modes and specifies initial
-        output pin value if given, otherwise the state of the pin peripheral remains
-        unchanged.
-
-      - ``drive`` specifies the output power of the pin and can be one of: ``Pin.DRIVE_0``,
-        ``Pin.DRIVE_1``, etc., increasing in drive strength.  The actual current driving
-        capabilities are port dependent.  Not all ports implement this argument.
-
-      - ``alt`` specifies an alternate function for the pin and the values it can take are
-        port dependent.  This argument is valid only for ``Pin.ALT`` and ``Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN``
-        modes.  It may be used when a pin supports more than one alternate function.  If only
-        one pin alternate function is supported the this argument is not required.  Not all
-        ports implement this argument.
-
-    As specified above, the Pin class allows to set an alternate function for a particular
-    pin, but it does not specify any further operations on such a pin.  Pins configured in
-    alternate-function mode are usually not used as GPIO but are instead driven by other
-    hardware peripherals.  The only operation supported on such a pin is re-initialising,
-    by calling the constructor or :meth:`Pin.init` method.  If a pin that is configured in
-    alternate-function mode is re-initialised with ``Pin.IN``, ``Pin.OUT``, or
-    ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN``, the alternate function will be removed from the pin.

-
-             - ``wake`` selects the power mode in which this interrupt can wake up the
-               system.  It can be ``machine.IDLE``, ``machine.SLEEP`` or ``machine.DEEPSLEEP``.

+
+    The arguments are:
+
+      - ``id`` is mandatory and can be an arbitrary object.  Among possible value
+        types are: int (an internal Pin identifier), str (a Pin name), and tuple
+        (pair of [port, pin]).
+
+      - ``mode`` specifies the pin mode, which can be one of:
+
+        - ``Pin.IN`` - Pin is configured for input.  If viewed as an output the pin
+          is in high-impedance state.
+
+        - ``Pin.OUT`` - Pin is configured for (normal) output.
+
+        - ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN`` - Pin is configured for open-drain output. Open-drain
+          output works in the following way: if the output value is set to 0 the pin
+          is active at a low level; if the output value is 1 the pin is in a high-impedance
+          state.  Not all ports implement this mode, or some might only on certain pins.
+
+        - ``Pin.ALT`` - Pin is configured to perform an alternative function, which is
+          port specific.  For a pin configured in such a way any other Pin methods
+          (except :meth:`Pin.init`) are not applicable (calling them will lead to undefined,
+          or a hardware-specific, result).  Not all ports implement this mode.
+
+        - ``Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN`` - The Same as ``Pin.ALT``, but the pin is configured as
+          open-drain.  Not all ports implement this mode.
+
+        - ``Pin.ANALOG`` - Pin is configured for analog input, see the :class:`ADC` class.
+
+      - ``pull`` specifies if the pin has a (weak) pull resistor attached, and can be
+        one of:
+
+        - ``None`` - No pull up or down resistor.
+        - ``Pin.PULL_UP`` - Pull up resistor enabled.
+        - ``Pin.PULL_DOWN`` - Pull down resistor enabled.
+
+      - ``value`` is valid only for Pin.OUT and Pin.OPEN_DRAIN modes and specifies initial
+        output pin value if given, otherwise the state of the pin peripheral remains
+        unchanged.
+
+      - ``drive`` specifies the output power of the pin and can be one of: ``Pin.DRIVE_0``,
+        ``Pin.DRIVE_1``, etc., increasing in drive strength.  The actual current driving
+        capabilities are port dependent.  Not all ports implement this argument.
+
+      - ``alt`` specifies an alternate function for the pin and the values it can take are
+        port dependent.  This argument is valid only for ``Pin.ALT`` and ``Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN``
+        modes.  It may be used when a pin supports more than one alternate function.  If only
+        one pin alternate function is supported the this argument is not required.  Not all
+        ports implement this argument.
+
+    As specified above, the Pin class allows to set an alternate function for a particular
+    pin, but it does not specify any further operations on such a pin.  Pins configured in
+    alternate-function mode are usually not used as GPIO but are instead driven by other
+    hardware peripherals.  The only operation supported on such a pin is re-initialising,
+    by calling the constructor or :meth:`Pin.init` method.  If a pin that is configured in
+    alternate-function mode is re-initialised with ``Pin.IN``, ``Pin.OUT``, or
+    ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN``, the alternate function will be removed from the pin.

+               ``Pin`` instance.
+
+             - ``trigger`` configures the event which can generate an interrupt.
+               Possible values are:
+
+               - ``Pin.IRQ_FALLING`` interrupt on falling edge.
+               - ``Pin.IRQ_RISING`` interrupt on rising edge.

+
+               These values can be OR'ed together to trigger on multiple events.
+
+             - ``priority`` sets the priority level of the interrupt.  The values it
+               can take are port-specific, but higher values always represent higher
+               priorities.
+
+             - ``wake`` selects the power mode in which this interrupt can wake up the
+               system.  It can be ``machine.IDLE``, ``machine.SLEEP`` or ``machine.DEEPSLEEP``.
+               These values can also be OR'ed together to make a pin generate interrupts in
+               more than one power mode.
+
+             - ``hard`` if true a hardware interrupt is used. This reduces the delay
+               between the pin change and the handler being called. Hard interrupt
+               handlers may not allocate memory; see :ref:`isr_rules`.

-time is responsibility of OS/RTOS and is done outside of MicroPython,

-may be set using ``machine.RTC().datetime(tuple)`` function, and maintained

-
-* By a backup battery (which may be an additional, optional component for

-* Using networked time protocol (requires setup by a port/user).
-* Set manually by a user on each power-up (many boards then maintain
-  RTC time across hard resets, though some may require setting it again

-def ticks_diff(ticks1, ticks2) -> int:
-    """
-    Measure ticks difference between values returned from `ticks_ms()`, `ticks_us()`,
-    or `ticks_cpu()` functions, as a signed value which may wrap around.
-
-    The argument order is the same as for subtraction
-    operator, ``ticks_diff(ticks1, ticks2)`` has the same meaning as ``ticks1 - ticks2``.
-    However, values returned by `ticks_ms()`, etc. functions may wrap around, so
-    directly using subtraction on them will produce incorrect result. That is why
-    `ticks_diff()` is needed, it implements modular (or more specifically, ring)
-    arithmetics to produce correct result even for wrap-around values (as long as they not
-    too distant inbetween, see below). The function returns **signed** value in the range
-    [*-TICKS_PERIOD/2* .. *TICKS_PERIOD/2-1*] (that's a typical range definition for
-    two's-complement signed binary integers). If the result is negative, it means that
-    *ticks1* occurred earlier in time than *ticks2*. Otherwise, it means that
-    *ticks1* occurred after *ticks2*. This holds **only** if *ticks1* and *ticks2*
-    are apart from each other for no more than *TICKS_PERIOD/2-1* ticks. If that does
-    not hold, incorrect result will be returned. Specifically, if two tick values are
-    apart for *TICKS_PERIOD/2-1* ticks, that value will be returned by the function.
-    However, if *TICKS_PERIOD/2* of real-time ticks has passed between them, the
-    function will return *-TICKS_PERIOD/2* instead, i.e. result value will wrap around
-    to the negative range of possible values.
-
-    Informal rationale of the constraints above: Suppose you are locked in a room with no
-    means to monitor passing of time except a standard 12-notch clock. Then if you look at
-    dial-plate now, and don't look again for another 13 hours (e.g., if you fall for a
-    long sleep), then once you finally look again, it may seem to you that only 1 hour
-    has passed. To avoid this mistake, just look at the clock regularly. Your application
-    should do the same. "Too long sleep" metaphor also maps directly to application
-    behaviour: don't let your application run any single task for too long. Run tasks
-    in steps, and do time-keeping inbetween.
-
-    `ticks_diff()` is designed to accommodate various usage patterns, among them:
-
-    * Polling with timeout. In this case, the order of events is known, and you will deal
-      only with positive results of `ticks_diff()`::
-
-         # Wait for GPIO pin to be asserted, but at most 500us
-         start = time.ticks_us()
-         while pin.value() == 0:
-             if time.ticks_diff(time.ticks_us(), start) > 500:
-                 raise TimeoutError
-
-    * Scheduling events. In this case, `ticks_diff()` result may be negative
-      if an event is overdue::
-
-         # This code snippet is not optimized
-         now = time.ticks_ms()
-         scheduled_time = task.scheduled_time()
-         if ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now) > 0:
-             print("Too early, let's nap")
-             sleep_ms(ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now))
-             task.run()
-         elif ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now) == 0:
-             print("Right at time!")
-             task.run()
-         elif ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now) < 0:
-             print("Oops, running late, tell task to run faster!")
-             task.run(run_faster=true)
-

+The ``time`` module provides functions for getting the current time and date,
+measuring time intervals, and for delays.
+
+**Time Epoch**: Unix port uses standard for POSIX systems epoch of
+1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. However, embedded ports use epoch of
+2000-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.
+
+**Maintaining actual calendar date/time**: This requires a
+Real Time Clock (RTC). On systems with underlying OS (including some
+RTOS), an RTC may be implicit. Setting and maintaining actual calendar
+time is responsibility of OS/RTOS and is done outside of MicroPython,
+it just uses OS API to query date/time. On baremetal ports however
+system time depends on ``machine.RTC()`` object. The current calendar time
+may be set using ``machine.RTC().datetime(tuple)`` function, and maintained
+by following means:
+
+* By a backup battery (which may be an additional, optional component for
+  a particular board).
+* Using networked time protocol (requires setup by a port/user).
+* Set manually by a user on each power-up (many boards then maintain
+  RTC time across hard resets, though some may require setting it again
+  in such case).
+
+If actual calendar time is not maintained with a system/MicroPython RTC,
+functions below which require reference to current absolute time may
+behave not as expected.

+def ticks_diff(ticks1, ticks2) -> int:
+    """
+    Measure ticks difference between values returned from `ticks_ms()`, `ticks_us()`,
+    or `ticks_cpu()` functions, as a signed value which may wrap around.
+
+    The argument order is the same as for subtraction
+    operator, ``ticks_diff(ticks1, ticks2)`` has the same meaning as ``ticks1 - ticks2``.
+    However, values returned by `ticks_ms()`, etc. functions may wrap around, so
+    directly using subtraction on them will produce incorrect result. That is why
+    `ticks_diff()` is needed, it implements modular (or more specifically, ring)
+    arithmetics to produce correct result even for wrap-around values (as long as they not
+    too distant inbetween, see below). The function returns **signed** value in the range
+    [*-TICKS_PERIOD/2* .. *TICKS_PERIOD/2-1*] (that's a typical range definition for
+    two's-complement signed binary integers). If the result is negative, it means that
+    *ticks1* occurred earlier in time than *ticks2*. Otherwise, it means that
+    *ticks1* occurred after *ticks2*. This holds **only** if *ticks1* and *ticks2*
+    are apart from each other for no more than *TICKS_PERIOD/2-1* ticks. If that does
+    not hold, incorrect result will be returned. Specifically, if two tick values are
+    apart for *TICKS_PERIOD/2-1* ticks, that value will be returned by the function.
+    However, if *TICKS_PERIOD/2* of real-time ticks has passed between them, the
+    function will return *-TICKS_PERIOD/2* instead, i.e. result value will wrap around
+    to the negative range of possible values.
+
+    Informal rationale of the constraints above: Suppose you are locked in a room with no
+    means to monitor passing of time except a standard 12-notch clock. Then if you look at
+    dial-plate now, and don't look again for another 13 hours (e.g., if you fall for a
+    long sleep), then once you finally look again, it may seem to you that only 1 hour
+    has passed. To avoid this mistake, just look at the clock regularly. Your application
+    should do the same. "Too long sleep" metaphor also maps directly to application
+    behaviour: don't let your application run any single task for too long. Run tasks
+    in steps, and do time-keeping inbetween.
+
+    `ticks_diff()` is designed to accommodate various usage patterns, among them:
+
+    * Polling with timeout. In this case, the order of events is known, and you will deal
+      only with positive results of `ticks_diff()`::
+
+         # Wait for GPIO pin to be asserted, but at most 500us
+         start = time.ticks_us()
+         while pin.value() == 0:
+             if time.ticks_diff(time.ticks_us(), start) > 500:
+                 raise TimeoutError
+
+    * Scheduling events. In this case, `ticks_diff()` result may be negative
+      if an event is overdue::
+
+         # This code snippet is not optimized
+         now = time.ticks_ms()
+         scheduled_time = task.scheduled_time()
+         if ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now) > 0:
+             print("Too early, let's nap")
+             sleep_ms(ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now))
+             task.run()
+         elif ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now) == 0:
+             print("Right at time!")
+             task.run()
+         elif ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now) < 0:
+             print("Oops, running late, tell task to run faster!")
+             task.run(run_faster=true)
+
+    Note: Do not pass `time()` values to `ticks_diff()`, you should use
+    normal mathematical operations on them. But note that `time()` may (and will)
+    also overflow. This is known as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem .

+
+def ticks_add(ticks, delta) -> Any:
+    """
+    Offset ticks value by a given number, which can be either positive or negative.
+    Given a *ticks* value, this function allows to calculate ticks value *delta*
+    ticks before or after it, following modular-arithmetic definition of tick values
+    (see `ticks_ms()` above). *ticks* parameter must be a direct result of call
+    to `ticks_ms()`, `ticks_us()`, or `ticks_cpu()` functions (or from previous
+    call to `ticks_add()`). However, *delta* can be an arbitrary integer number
+    or numeric expression. `ticks_add()` is useful for calculating deadlines for
+    events/tasks. (Note: you must use `ticks_diff()` function to work with
+    deadlines.)
+
+    Examples::
+
+         # Find out what ticks value there was 100ms ago
+         print(ticks_add(time.ticks_ms(), -100))
