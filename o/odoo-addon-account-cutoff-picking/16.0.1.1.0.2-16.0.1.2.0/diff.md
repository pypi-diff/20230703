 This module generates expense/revenue accruals and prepaid expense/revenue based on the status of orders, pickings and invoices. The module is named *account_cutoff_accrual_picking* because it initially only supported accruals ; support for prepaid expense/revenue was added later (it should be renamed in later versions).
 
 To understand the behavior of this module, let's take the example of an expense accrual. When you click on the button *Re-Generate Lines* of an *Expense Accrual*:
 
-1. Odoo will look for all incoming picking in Done state with a *Transfer Date* <= *Cut-off Date*. For performance reasons, by default, the incoming picking dated before *Cut-off Date* minus 90 days will not be taken into account (this limit is configurable via the field *Picking Analysis*). It will go to the stock moves of those pickings and see if they are linked to a purchase order line.
+1. Odoo will look for all incoming picking in Done state with a *Transfer Date* <= *Cut-off Date*. For performance reasons, by default, the incoming picking dated before *Cut-off Date* minus 30 days will not be taken into account (this limit is configurable via the field *Picking Analysis*). It will go to the stock moves of those pickings and see if they are linked to a purchase order line.
 2. Once this analysis is completed, Odoo has a list of purchase order lines to analyse for potential expense accrual.
 3. For each of these purchase order lines, Odoo will:
 
    - scan the related stock moves in *done* state and check their transfer date,
    - scan the related invoices lines and check their invoice date.
 
 4. If, for a particular purchase order line, the quantity of products received before the cutoff-date (or on the same day) minus the quantity of products invoiced before the cut-off date (or on the same day) is positive, Odoo will generate a cut-off line.
 
 Now, let's take the example of a prepaid expense. When you click on the button *Re-Generate Lines* of a *Prepaid Expense*:
 
-1. Odoo will look for all vendor bills dated before (or equal to) *Cut-off Date*. For performance reasons, by default, the vendor bills dated before *Cut-off Date* minus 90 days will not be taken into account (this limit is configurable via the field *Picking Analysis*). It will go to the invoice lines of those vendor bills and see if they are linked to a purchase order line.

The module is named *account_cutoff_accrual_picking* because it initially only supported accruals ; support for prepaid expense/revenue was added later (it should be renamed in later versions).
 
 To understand the behavior of this module, let's take the example of an expense accrual. When you click on the button *Re-Generate Lines* of an *Expense Accrual*:
 
-1. Odoo will look for all incoming picking in Done state with a *Transfer Date* <= *Cut-off Date*. For performance reasons, by default, the incoming picking dated before *Cut-off Date* minus 90 days will not be taken into account (this limit is configurable via the field *Picking Analysis*). It will go to the stock moves of those pickings and see if they are linked to a purchase order line.
+1. Odoo will look for all incoming picking in Done state with a *Transfer Date* <= *Cut-off Date*. For performance reasons, by default, the incoming picking dated before *Cut-off Date* minus 30 days will not be taken into account (this limit is configurable via the field *Picking Analysis*). It will go to the stock moves of those pickings and see if they are linked to a purchase order line.
 2. Once this analysis is completed, Odoo has a list of purchase order lines to analyse for potential expense accrual.
 3. For each of these purchase order lines, Odoo will:
 
    - scan the related stock moves in *done* state and check their transfer date,
    - scan the related invoices lines and check their invoice date.
 
 4. If, for a particular purchase order line, the quantity of products received before the cutoff-date (or on the same day) minus the quantity of products invoiced before the cut-off date (or on the same day) is positive, Odoo will generate a cut-off line.
 
 Now, let's take the example of a prepaid expense. When you click on the button *Re-Generate Lines* of a *Prepaid Expense*:
 
-1. Odoo will look for all vendor bills dated before (or equal to) *Cut-off Date*. For performance reasons, by default, the vendor bills dated before *Cut-off Date* minus 90 days will not be taken into account (this limit is configurable via the field *Picking Analysis*). It will go to the invoice lines of those vendor bills and see if they are linked to a purchase order line.
